It is being co-hosted by the West Indies and the United States from 1 to 29 June 2024.[1] It is the first major ICC event tournament to feature matches played in the United States, and in any other country in the Americas outside the West Indies.[2] The West Indies is hosting the T20 World Cup for the second time, after having previously hosted the 2010 edition.[3] England are the defending champions, having defeated Pakistan in the final of the previous edition.\\n\\nThe tournament is being contested by a record 20 teams, an expansion from 16 teams at the 2022 tournament; this includes the two hosts, the top eight teams from the 2022 edition, the next two teams in the ICC Men\\'s T20I Team Rankings, and eight teams determined by regional qualifiers. Canada and Uganda qualified for the men\\'s T20 World Cup for the first time, while the United States is participating for the first time by virtue of being co-host.\\n\\nFormat\\n\\nThe 20 qualifying teams have been divided into four groups of five teams; the top two teams in each group will advance to the Super 8 round.[1][4] In this stage, the qualifying teams will be split into two groups of four; the top two teams from each group will qualify for the knockout stage, which will consist of two semi-finals and a final.[5]\\n\\nHost selection\\n\\nIn November 2021, the International Cricket Council (ICC) announced that the 2024 Men\\'s T20 World Cup would be played in the United States and the West Indies.[6] A joint bid was submitted by Cricket West Indies and USA Cricket following two years of preparation, forming part of a strategic partnership between the two associations.[7]\\n\\nTeams and qualification\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\n2024 ICC Men\\'s T20 World Cup qualification\\n\\nThe top eight teams from the 2022 tournament and the two hosts qualified automatically for the tournament. The remaining two automatic qualification places were taken by the best-ranked teams in the ICC Men\\'s T20I Team Rankings which had not already secured a place in the finals, as of 14 November 2022.[8][9]\\n\\nThe eight remaining places were filled via the ICC\\'s regional qualifiers, consisting of two teams from Africa, Asia, and Europe and one team each from the Americas and the East Asia-Pacific groups.[10] In May 2022, the ICC confirmed the sub-regional qualification pathways for Europe, East Asia-Pacific, and Africa.[11]\\n\\nIreland and\\n\\nScotland from the\\n\\nEurope Qualifier became the first two teams to qualify, followed by\\n\\nPapua New Guinea from the\\n\\nEast Asia-Pacific Qualifier.\\n\\n[12]\\n\\n[13]\\n\\nCanada secured its qualification in October 2023 after defeating\\n\\nBermuda in its final match in the\\n\\nAmericas Qualifier.\\n\\n[14]\\n\\nNepal and\\n\\nOman qualified after reaching the final of the\\n\\nAsia Qualifier in Nepal,\\n\\n[15]\\n\\nNamibia and\\n\\nUganda becoming the final two teams to qualify  after ensuring a top-two finish in the\\n\\nAfrica Qualifier.\\n\\nZimbabwe became the only Test-playing country that failed to qualify.\\n\\n[16]\\n\\n[17]\\n\\nMethod of qualification Date of qualification Venues Number of teams Team Hosts 16 November 2021 — 2 United States West Indies 2022 ICC Men\\'s T20 World Cup (Top 8 teams from the previous tournament) 13 November 2022 Australia 8 Australia England India Netherlands New Zealand Pakistan South Africa Sri Lanka ICC Men\\'s T20I Team Rankings 14 November 2022 — 2 Afghanistan Bangladesh Europe Qualifier 20-28 July 2023 Scotland 2 Ireland Scotland East Asia-Pacific Qualifier 22-29 July 2023 Papua New Guinea 1 Papua New Guinea Americas Qualifier 30 September-7 October 2023 Bermuda 1 Canada Asia Qualifier 30 October–5 November 2023 Nepal 2 Nepal Oman Africa Qualifier 22–30 November 2023 Namibia 2 Namibia Uganda Total 20\\n\\nMatch officials\\n\\nOn 3 May 2024, the International Cricket Council released the list of match referees and umpires for the tournament\\'s first round.[18][19]\\n\\nMatch referees\\n\\nDavid Boon\\n\\nJeff Crowe\\n\\nRanjan Madugalle\\n\\nAndy Pycroft\\n\\nRichie Richardson\\n\\nJavagal Srinath\\n\\nUmpires\\n\\nChris Brown\\n\\nKumar Dharmasena\\n\\nChris Gaffaney\\n\\nMichael Gough\\n\\nAdrian Holdstock\\n\\nRichard Illingworth\\n\\nRichard Kettleborough\\n\\nJayaraman Madanagopal\\n\\nNitin Menon\\n\\nSam Nogajski\\n\\nAllahudien Paleker\\n\\nAhsan Raza\\n\\nRashid Riaz\\n\\nPaul Reiffel\\n\\nLangton Rusere\\n\\nSharfuddoula\\n\\nRod Tucker\\n\\nAlex Wharf\\n\\nJoel Wilson\\n\\nAsif Yaqoob\\n\\nSquads\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\n2024 ICC Men\\'s T20 World Cup squads\\n\\nNew Zealand was the first team to announce its squad for the tournament.\\n\\n[20]\\n\\nEngland,\\n\\nIndia, and\\n\\nSouth Africa followed suit by announcing their squads.\\n\\n[21]\\n\\n[22]\\n\\n[23]\\n\\nAustralia,\\n\\nAfghanistan,\\n\\nOman, and\\n\\nNepal also announced their squads.\\n\\n[24]\\n\\n[25]\\n\\n[26]\\n\\n[27]\\n\\nCanada, in its debut T20 World Cup appearance, announced its squad on 2 May 2024.\\n\\n[28]\\n\\nHosts West Indies and the United States announced their squads on 3 May 2024,[29][30]  whereas Scotland and newcomers Uganda announced their squads on 6 May 2024.[31][32] While Ireland and Papua New Guinea announced their squads on 7 May 2024, Sri Lanka announced their squad on 9 May 2024.[33][34][35]\\n\\nNamibia announced their squad on 10 May 2024 and Netherlands announced their squad on 13 May 2024.[36][37] Bangladesh announced their squad on 14 May 2024 and Pakistan became the final team to announce their squad for the tournament on 24 May 2024.[38][39]\\n\\nVenues\\n\\nIn May 2023, CWI began a thorough bidding process for countries in the Caribbean region and the United States willing to host the matches of the World Cup.[40]\\n\\nCentral Broward Park in\\n\\nLauderhill, Florida,\\n\\nChurch Street Park in\\n\\nMorrisville, North Carolina,\\n\\nGrand Prairie Stadium in\\n\\nGrand Prairie, Texas, and a temporary stadium at\\n\\nVan Cortlandt Park in\\n\\nthe Bronx,\\n\\nNew York City.\\n\\n[41]\\n\\n[42]\\n\\n[43]\\n\\nEisenhower Park on\\n\\nLong Island in\\n\\nNassau County, New York.

Nigel Camacho, the president of the Queen\\'s Park Cricket Club, stated that the venue would instead most likely host warm-up matches before the start of the main tournament. Also, the Government of Dominica decided to withdraw its venue, Windsor Park, from hosting any matches of the World Cup citing their inability to complete the infrastructural development of the venue before the tournament commences.[51][52]\\n\\nIn December 2023, a delegation of representatives from the ICC and CWI undertook a second inspection of the confirmed World Cup host countries in the Caribbean and host cities in the United States, also finalizing the fixtures for the tournament. The Long Island stadium will most notably host the India–Pakistan group stage match, part of what has been considered one of the largest rivalries in the sport.[53][54]\\n\\nOn 17 January 2024, the ICC unveiled the proposed design of the temporary Long Island stadium—Nassau County International Cricket Stadium—which is expected to be ready by the end of May 2024.[55]\\n\\nVenues in the West

This will be played as a single round-robin, with the top two teams in each group advancing to the knockout stage.[1] Prior to the tournament, the ICC announced the eight seeded teams for the Super 8 stages — Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and the West Indies. Should they advance from the group stage, they will be placed in pre-determined positions, regardless of whether they finish first or second in their group. If an unseeded team qualifies at the expense of a seeded team, they will directly replace said team in the Super 8 group.[63][64] No points are carried over from the group stage to the Super 8.[65]\\n\\nQualification Super 8 Group 1 Group 2 Advanced from group stage (Top 8 teams) A1 A2 B2 B1 C1 C2 D2 D1\\n\\nGroup 1\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\n2024 ICC Men\\'s T20 World Cup Super 8 Group 1\\n\\nPos Team v t e Pld W L NR Pts NRR Qualification 1 A1 0 0 0 0 0 — Advance to knockout stage 2 B2 0 0 0 0 0 — 3 C1 0 0 0 0 0 — 4 D2 0 0 0 0 0 —\\n\\nFirst match(es) will be played: 20 June 2024.
